**Q: How can I improve system performance?**
A: 
1. Use modern browser with hardware acceleration
2. Maintain stable internet connection
3. Monitor and limit agent count based on resources
4. Enable SIMD acceleration when available
5. Regularly restart agents to clear memory

**Q: Why are some agents slower than others?**
A: Different agent types have different computational requirements. Coordinator agents use more resources for coordination overhead, while Researcher agents are optimized for efficiency. Task complexity also affects performance.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot performance issues?**
A: Check the Statistics view for real-time metrics, monitor memory usage, verify internet connection stability, and consider reducing agent count temporarily. The system provides detailed diagnostic information and alerts.

### Project Management and Integration

**Q: How does GitHub integration work?**
A: SASI monitors public GitHub repositories, tracking activity, issues, and contributions. Users can vote for projects to prioritize them for agent attention. Agents can assist with code review, issue analysis, and development tasks.

**Q: Can I integrate SASI with my existing tools?**
A: Yes, SASI provides REST APIs and WebSocket events for integration with external tools. SDKs are available for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, with webhook support for real-time integrations.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many projects I can add?**
A: No strict limit, but system performance may be affected by monitoring too many projects simultaneously. The system will provide guidance on optimal project counts based on your agent capacity.

**Q: How does the voting system work?**
A: Each user can vote once per project. Votes determine project priority for agent assignment, with higher-voted projects receiving more agent attention. Voting helps the community decide focus areas democratically.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What technology powers the neural agents?**
A: Agents use real neural networks powered by ruv-FANN WASM backend with SIMD optimization. Multiple architectures are supported including MLP, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes, SASI includes enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication, encrypted data storage, secure API endpoints, and comprehensive access controls. Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

**Q: Can I export my agent configurations?**
A: Yes, agent configurations can be exported for backup or reuse. The system also provides automatic backup and recovery capabilities for important data.

**Q: What happens to my agents when I close the browser?**
A: Agents continue running on the server side. When you reconnect, you'll see your agents in their current state. Long-running tasks continue processing even when you're not actively viewing the interface.

### Billing and Limits

**Q: Are there usage limits?**
A: The system includes rate limiting and resource management to ensure fair usage. Specific limits depend on your account type and subscription level. Alerts notify you when approaching limits.

**Q: How is resource usage calculated?**
A: Usage is based on agent-hours, computational operations, and resource consumption. The system provides detailed usage analytics and cost tracking in the Statistics view.

**Q: Can I upgrade or downgrade my usage?**
A: Yes, the system supports flexible scaling. Contact support for information about different usage tiers and enterprise options.
